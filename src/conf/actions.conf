# Actions file for icmpKNOCK
# The name of the action has no influence on further behaviour. As long as a 
# section defines the options 'keys' and 'payload' it will be threaten as an 
# action.
#
# General syntax for actions:
# [_PUT YOUR ACTIONS NAME HERE_]
# keys = <key1>, <key2>, ...
# payload = <put command here> 
#
# You can of course use new-lines as shown below:
# keys = <key1>,
#        <key2>,
#        ...
# CAUTION: If you use the same action name in several definitions, only the
# latest one will be used, since earlier definitions will be overwritten by 
# the next ones. 


# Define here actions
